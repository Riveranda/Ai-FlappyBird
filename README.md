# AI-FlappyBird
> This project was made to demonstrate the power of the NEATS neural network when applied to </br>

> # Pygame</br>
> In order to implement NEATS on flappy bird, the game itself was first implemented using</br>
> the legendary module, pygame. Running at 30fps, I did my best to replicate the</br>
> physics and feel of the original game. From there it was time to implement our neural netowrk.

> # NEATS</br>
> The NEATS neural network was implemented using generational learning.</br>
> Only the best members of each generation are chosen to go on. Birds are rewarded for reaching</br>
> further in the level, and receive a huge boost to their fitness when they pass through a pipe.</br>

> After several generations, the birds have finally learned to navigate through this simple game,</br>
> and given time these super birds can become near perfect and achieve scores in the thousands.
